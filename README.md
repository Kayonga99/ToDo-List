# To-do list - List Structure

> In this project, you will see a simple HTML list of "To Do tasks". This simple web page was built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.

> Everything you need to start using webpack is all setup and ready to use just run the following commands to get started:

Get started by copying and pasting the following in your terminal: 

- 1
```
npm install
```

- 2

 This will generate a dist folder you never edit what is in there.
```
npm run build
```


- 3

```
npm start
```
The browser will open and you should see this text : "Hello webpack!", if this is not the case please stay calm and simply open your browser and paste this.
